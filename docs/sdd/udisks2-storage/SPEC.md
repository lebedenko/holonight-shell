  swap and OS infrastructure volumes; HintSystem alone shall not hide data volumes.
- R3: Shell shall show removable devices with media; Files shall additionally show empty removable drives and
  mounted fixed data volumes. Locked volumes shall be unavailable; unlocked backing rows shall not duplicate them.
- R4: Manual actions shall use opaque IDs, display busy/error state, and expose capability-appropriate actions.
  Power-off shall display the full affected scope before confirmation and reject stale confirmation.
- R5: Files shall mount before navigating and discard a completion after superseding navigation or activation.
  Removal/unmount of the displayed filesystem shall cancel stale work and return Home with an explanation.
- R6: Files shall preserve keyboard access and modal guards. Shell shall use the existing status-popup framework
  and hide the storage indicator when no eligible device remains.

Automatic mounting, unlock, disk administration and network/FUSE discovery remain excluded.
